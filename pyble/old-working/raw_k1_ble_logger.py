Description:
  This script scans for BLE devices whose name contains 'Kinisi' (or whatever
  your device advertises itself as). Once found, it connects, subscribes
  to the "UART RX" characteristic (or whichever handle/UUID your device uses),
  and starts printing incoming data to console. You can also enable file
  logging to store the data for offline analysis.
